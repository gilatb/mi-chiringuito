You run a chiringuito (the Spanish term for a bar on the beach) at Bogatell beach.

Given an object that represents the inventory of your chiringuito, add a method 'inventory' to your object that returns the current value of the chiringuito's inventory.

//EXTRA CREDIT!
Add a sale method that takes an order object, returns the price of the order, updates the inventory of the purchased items, and adds the price of the order to the company's cash property.
